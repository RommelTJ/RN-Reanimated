# Cubic Bezier

* Bezier curves are an incredibly powerful mathematical tool to build vector drawings.
* Bezier curves have a start and end point, and two control points.
* Exciting because:  
  * We can see heterogeneous things in a homogenous way. This makes it easy to animate things.
  * Lot of interesting math to implement cursor along graphs.
  * Good for easing.
* Tool for calculating bezier curves: https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67
* See rn-app-examples/src/Bezier.
