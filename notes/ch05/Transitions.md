* Transitions are the easiest way to animate RN components.
* See: `rn-app-examples/src/Transitions/index.ts`
* You can transition using React State or Animation Values
  * React State (shipped with Redash)
    * Timing: `useTiming()`
    * Spring: `useSpring()`
  * Animation Value (shipped with Reanimated 2)
    * Timing: `withTiming()`
    * Spring: `withSpring()`
