# Morphing Shapes

* Lesson covers how to morph shapes
* Based on an example (Cuberto) written in Swift UI
* Each shape is a concatenation of Bezier Curves
* Bezier curves are just 4 parameters: Start point, control point 1, control point 2, and destination point
* Example will be built in two steps:  
  * First we will build the slider
  * Then we will animate the shapes and background
* See: rn-app-examples/src/ShapeMorphing
